# Fashion Site - Frontend Development Practice

![Design preview for the Fashion Site coding challenge](../designs/NamelazzFinal.png)
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Hi, my name is LaMonte and thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Fashion Site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Where to find everything

The PNG I used to create this site is located inside the `/design` folder.

The project was built from a PNG static format reference, therefore I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I'm always looking to improve my coding skills, so if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email lamonte.fields[at]gmail[dot]com.
